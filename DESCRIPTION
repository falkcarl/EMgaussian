Description: Initially designed to distribute code for
  estimating the Gaussian graphical model with Lasso regularization, also known
  as the graphical lasso (glasso), using an EM algorithm. The algorithm was
  based on extant research in the literature (Städler and Bühlmann, 2012). As a
  byproduct, code for estimating means and covariances (or the precision matrix)
  under a multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution is also available.
